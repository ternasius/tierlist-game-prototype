# My Web Development Learning Journey: Tier List Game Project

## Overview
This is my first web development project, created as a hands-on way to learn fundamental web technologies. The project is a tier list game where users can rank and organize their friends into different tiers, similar to popular tier list makers found online.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding HTML structure and semantic elements
- Learning CSS styling and layouts 
- Implementing JavaScript functionality
- Working with drag and drop APIs
- Handling JSON data
- Building interactive user interfaces

## Project Components

### 1. Tier List Maker
A drag-and-drop interface where users can:
- Move items between different tiers
- Items automatically arrange left-to-right, top-to-bottom
- Save their tier list arrangements
- View items in a clean, grid-based layout

### 2. TBD

## Future Development Goals
- [ ] Add ability to create custom tiers
- [ ] Add image support
- [ ] Create share functionality
- [ ] Implement settings for extra game customizability
- [ ] Create a lobby website for players to gather
- [ ] Deploy this project to the web

## Challenges & Learning Points
Throughout this project, I've learned:
- How to structure a web application
- Working with modern CSS layouts
- Implementing drag and drop functionality
- Managing data with JSON
- Problem-solving through debugging
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable code

## Setup and Usage
Currently this project is fragmented into different components. I hope to compile each component into one game once I've learned the necessary skills.

## Notes
This is a learning project, and the code may not represent best practices in all areas. I'm continuously improving and refactoring as I learn more about web development.

## Future Learning Goals
- Learn about web accessibility
- Implement responsive design best practices
- Explore frontend frameworks
- Add backend functionality
- Implement user authentication
- Learn about database integration
